/* Tailwind base, components, and utilities are loaded via CDN in index.html */
/* This file can be used for very minimal global overrides if absolutely necessary, */
/* but the goal is to use Tailwind classes for everything. */

/* Example: ensure html and body take full height */
/* html, body, #root {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
} */
/* This is often handled by Tailwind's preflight or can be added to body class in index.html */
